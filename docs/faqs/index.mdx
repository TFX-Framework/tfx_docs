## What is TFX-Framework?
- A custom Roleplay Framework which will be completely free and easy to use for anyone.

---

## What makes this framework different?
Of course, it is a framework that is being made from scratch. 
Means it will be behind ESX or VRP, but there are far too many servers using these frameworks... 
which is why this is unique!

**Features**
- Custom ExternalSQL by Xander1998
- Custom, Easy to use API by Toxic Dev
- A Complete framework made from scratch
- Hardcore RP Server setup
- Best performance (FPS)

---

## Does this work with ESX?

No resources in this framework will work without having the TFX Files, which are stated in the fxmanifest dependencies.

---

## Do I need to change the 2000 port inside externalSQL to connect to MySQL?
- No, this port is used by ExternalSQL to speak, and should be different than the port used by MySQL (3306 by default). So it needs a non-use port!

## When is my Requested Feature be added?
- When it is ready for actions, the team behind TFX is not bonded by any schedule. and make sure everything is working fine when they release a new resource. So you need to understand that this process takes some time.

---

## Can I make a resource for the TFX Framework?
- Sure, and we would love to see it! You can DM Toxic with what you created so we can put it under #tfx-community-releases
